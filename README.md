# find-open-reading-frames
A script to find open reading frames (ORF) in the nucleotide sequence in input as FASTA file.

find_ORF.py supports multiple CLI options supplied by the user:
* setting minimum nucleotide length for ORF detection (default = 300);
* translating ORFs into peptide sequences;
* selecting the translation table (see BioPython documentation);
* option to write an output to a FASTA file;
* option to include ORFs with ambiguous calls;
* option to search ORFs with a start codon specified by the user.

Example input and output files are provided (see foo files)

More information regarding the use and options will be added later and in the meantime use --help flag for information on all options and parameters.
